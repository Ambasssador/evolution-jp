 TRANSLATION KIT FOR MODx 0.9.6 -- April 16, 2007

 The files located in the directories here represent the base core MODx files
 for a complete non-english language installation. There have been many 
 updates to the file from earlier releases.

 You can find convenient diffs of the base languages on our wiki located at:
    http://wiki.modxcms.com/index.php/Category:Language_Files

 The files contained in the translation kit follow. In the examples below, "english" should be changed to your actual language file name:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 README-xx.txt -- basic readme/new install instructions, where xx is your
                  country code. If you also have an alternate encoding, also
                  include the encoding, e.g., README-sv-utf8.txt. Also save 
                  this file (and ONLY this one) with CRLF line endings, for 
                  Windows users. (The rest should be LF only.)

 manager/english.inc.php -- main language file for manager
 manager/english_country.inc.php -- country include file

 snippet AjaxSearch/english.inc.php
 snippet ditto/english.inc.php
 snippet eform/english.inc.php

 plugin TinyMCE/english.inc.php

 module docmanager/english.inc.php
 modules quick_edit/english.inc.php
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 When sending the files back for committing to the repository, please change
 the enclosing folder to match the name and encoding of the language. If at
 all possible, try to stick with UTF-8. Thanks!
